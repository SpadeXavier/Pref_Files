# Pref_Files
A collection of assorted configuration and preference files on my Linux system

# Vim 
vimrc can be placed under /etc/vimrc for all users or ~/.vimrc for only one
user

# Sublime 
File headers have location of where to place files 
If you want to use a .sublime-settings file with the change_subl_settings
script then place it under ~/.config/sublime_preferences/
